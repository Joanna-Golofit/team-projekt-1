                    many assignments were invented by the teacher (exercises, warm-ups, consolidation of materials, etc.). It was seen
                    that Elena prepared very carefully for each lesson. There was no tension in the classes and the teacher

                    the first lesson I realized that I was on my plate. Elena and I became friends because of her
                    really worried about my success. She became an authority for me, but I did not tremble in class, having
                    fear of making the slightest mistake. Now I can brag that I'm a budget student; thanks deer i
                    was able to pass the competition for the English-speaking group, where the entire educational process is conducted exclusively in English.
                    After studying for only a year, I have many meetings with representatives from America and Europe. Thanks to fate,
                    which gave me a real teacher, I gained a certain level with which I can be in the field of education
                    and in the modern world in general.

                    So, for 6 months of preparation for ZNO I managed not only to study new material, but also to catch up
                    missed from school.
                    The process itself was interesting: during the training, various associations, tables and diagrams were used
                    contributed to the memorization of information.
                    Each theory is followed by practical tasks and tests that guarantee complete mastery of the topic.

                    additional). Elena has everything mobile. It is possible to solve on the way, in the subway, thereby saving time.
                    And yes! in May, Lena conducted a mock exam, the format of the external evaluation among graduates. Which really stimulated me
                    sit on the essays all the following days)
                    In conclusion, I am happy with the result. I recommend

                    I came to study with Lena exactly 9 months before the external evaluation, my level of English was basic, I really even
                    did not understand the times.
                    From the first lesson I realized that Lena is a very nice person and a master of her craft. I said I wanted to
                    to write ZNO on a high score, above 180. We had a large amount of work and my efforts.
                    Lena very clearly built our program, we started with the easiest, and in the end disassembled the most
                    complex designs. Throughout my studies, it was very interesting and enjoyable for me. Lena and I
                    talked like friends, could talk on different topics besides studying, and at the same time she could set up well in
                    the right moment to say: "Get together and do it, you can!"
                    As a result, I have 184 points for the external evaluation and 11 points for the DPA. My level of English has risen a lot and in many ways it is
                    the merit is Lena. Each of our lessons was productive and very valuable!
